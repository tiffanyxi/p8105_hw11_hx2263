```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

# Problem 1

### Import data

```{r data_import}
raw_homicide = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

### Data tidy

Create a city_state variable and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved; omit cities as required.
```{r}
homicide_tidy = 
  raw_homicide %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) %>% 
  mutate(status = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")))
```
