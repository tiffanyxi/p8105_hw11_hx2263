Problem 1
=========

### Import data

``` r
raw_homicide = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

### Data tidy

Create a city\_state variable and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved; omit cities as required.

``` r
homicide_tidy = 
  raw_homicide %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) %>% 
  mutate(status = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")))
```
